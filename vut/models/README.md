> The models may be subject to different licenses than the main library. When using these models, please make sure to comply with their respective licenses.

## Models Used

### I3D (Inflated 3D ConvNet)

- **Overview**: A 3D CNN for video recognition. It adopts an architecture that "inflates" 2D convolutions into 3D.
- **License**: [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- **Paper**: [Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07750)
- **Implementation Source**: [piergiaj/pytorch-i3d](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d)
- **License Compliance**: When using this model, you must comply with the Apache 2.0 license requirements including providing appropriate attribution.

## Usage

For usage instructions for each model, please refer to the docstrings in the corresponding Python files or implementation sources.
